# Inverse Reinforcement Learning
2021 Winter Project by Tianyu Li

This repo contains implementation of the following papers on inverse reinforcement learning. The purpose is to achieve robot learning from demonstration via inverse reinforcement learning.


## Linear Programming
Inverse reinforcement learning using linear programming based on the paper:  
*Ng, Andrew Y., and Stuart J. Russell. "Algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning." Icml. Vol. 1. 2000.*

```
python3 main.py
```

## Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning
Inverse reinforcement learning using maximum entropy deep learning based on the paper:
*Wulfmeier, Markus, Peter Ondruska, and Ingmar Posner. "Maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.04888 (2015).*

For 2D Environment with discretized (x,y) states
```
python3 main_MaxEnt.py
```

For 2D Environment with discretized (x,y,gripper) states
```
python3 main_Gripper.py
```

For 3D Environment with discretized (x,y,z,gripper) states
```
python3 main_Gripper3d.py
```

For visualization of the policy in pybullet. The models are saved in ```trained_model``` folder
```
python3 simulation.py
```

## Dependencies
